# Real-time Updates in Blazor WebAssembly App using SignalR

A full-stack Blazor WebAssembly application demonstrating real-time appointment scheduling with instant synchronization across multiple clients using [SignalR](https://learn.microsoft.com/aspnet/core/signalr) and [Syncfusion<sup style="font-size:70%">&reg;</sup> Blazor Scheduler](https://www.syncfusion.com/blazor-components/blazor-scheduler) components.

## Overview

This sample application showcases how to build a collaborative scheduling experience in Blazor WebAssembly with real-time updates. When one user creates, edits, or deletes an appointment, all connected clients instantly receive and display the changes through a SignalR hub connection. The application uses the Syncfusion Scheduler component to provide a rich, interactive calendar interface.

**Key capabilities:**

- Multi-user real-time synchronization via SignalR
- CRUD operations on appointments (create, read, update, delete)
- Syncfusion Scheduler component with built-in drag-and-drop and inline editing
- Separated architecture with Client (WebAssembly), Server (ASP.NET Core), and Shared projects

## Features

- **Real-time Synchronization**: All connected clients receive instant updates when appointments are changed
- **Interactive Scheduler**: Built on Syncfusion's Scheduler component with week view, inline editing, and drag-and-drop support
- **SignalR Integration**: Bidirectional communication between clients and server
- **Clean Architecture**: Organized into Client, Server, and Shared projects for maintainability
- **Activity Tracking**: Display notifications showing which user made what changes

## Architecture

The solution follows a three-project structure:

- **Client** (Blazor WebAssembly): The interactive UI running in the browser, featuring the Scheduler component and SignalR client logic
- **Server** (ASP.NET Core): Hosts the SignalR hub, serves static files, and provides REST API endpoints for appointment data
- **Shared**: Contains common models like `AppointmentData` shared between client and server

**Real-time Flow:**

1. User interacts with the Scheduler (creates, edits, or deletes an appointment)
2. Client sends changes via SignalR to the `SchedulerHub`
3. Hub broadcasts changes to all connected clients except the sender
4. All clients receive and apply the changes instantly
